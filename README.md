# ScratchAuth

## About

### What is it?
ScratchAuth (ScratchAuthenticator) is a free, open-source, third party authenticator for Scratch (scratch.mit.edu). It is currently in development but will be worked on soon.

### How does it work?
ScratchAuth uses the [scratch-api](https://github.com/trumank/scratch-api) JavaScript library to login to a Scratch account and authenticate other 3rd-party Scratch applications. It authenticates them over OAuth 2.0.

### Why should I trust ScratchAuth?
Because **we promise to never reveal your data to the public, and that your data is only asked for the application's purposes only**. You also have the right and *can* ask for us to revoke any of your data. **It is your choice and _your choice only_ whether you give us your data** (e.g. email addresses, Scratch username and password) **or not**.
